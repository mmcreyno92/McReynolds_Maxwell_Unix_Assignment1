# McReynolds_Maxwell_Unix_Assignment1
## Creating a Git Repository and Copying Files
In order to start the assignment I needed to create a Unix Assignment 1 Git Hub repository
I did this by logging on to my account on GitHub, chose the create repository option and then used the command-line based approach to initialize the depository and add this README.md file.
Once I had the repository named I followed the following GitHub instructions to create the repository:
```
echo "# McReynoldsUnixAssignment" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:mmcreyno92/McReynoldsUnixAssignment.git
git push -u origin master
```
